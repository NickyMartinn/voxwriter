# voxwriter
Blender 2.8 addon to export to the MagicaVoxel .vox format

Exports the selected object to a .vox and optionally creates a palette

### Installation
First download the latest release zip

To install, click "Install..." in Blender Preferences > Add-ons and select the zip.

For Windows users: This addon needs elevated privileges to your Blender install directory to grab dependencies, so if Blender is installed in Program Files, you'll need to launch Blender as administrator before you initially install the addon.
